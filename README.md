# Description 📃 :

👋 Hey guys, I've always wanted to easily test the animations in Fivem and I never really found the script that fits for what I want. So I decided to make my own and today I'm releasing it for free !

---
## Usage 🛠️ :

To use the resource, download it, put the `mth-animations` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start mth-animations` to your server.cfg.
Then, once you're in game, use the command `/animations` to toggle the menu.

<br>

### Config.lua: 
> By changing this to `true` will make the `/animations` command only accessible for **server admins**.
```lua
Config.AdminOnly = false 
```
---
## Features ✨ :
* Accessible json file for all animations dict and names
* Search button to specify what you're looking for
* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Change permissions of the command
* Up to date animations list
* Easy to use
